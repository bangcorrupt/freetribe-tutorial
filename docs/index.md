# Introduction

This is a tutorial for [Freetribe](https://github.com/bangcorrupt/freetribe), 
a free, open-source firmware for Electribe 2.
A series of code examples demonstrate features of the Freetribe API,
starting with basic operations and moving toward a more complex application.

Before continuing, review the [Getting Started](https://bangcorrupt.github.io/freetribe-docs/getting-started)
section of the [Freetribe Documentation](https://bangcorrupt.github.io/freetribe-docs/).
You will also need to [install the toolchain](https://bangcorrupt.github.io/freetribe-docs/toolchain) and 
[attach a debugger](https://bangcorrupt.github.io/freetribe-docs/debugging) in order to run the code examples.
